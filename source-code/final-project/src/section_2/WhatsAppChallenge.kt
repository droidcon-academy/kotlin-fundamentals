        Hey everyone!
        I was wondering if there's any interest in a cinema trip sometime soon?
        The most important thing is finding a date and time that works for as many of us as possible.
        Maybe a weekend afternoon or evening?
        Looking forward to hearing from you all and hopefully planning a fantastic movie outing soon!""".trimIndent()
